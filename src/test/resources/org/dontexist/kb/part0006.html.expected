 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">3. Through service to people, as worship of God, may your household life lead you to Liberation.</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">Make It Happen</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">The world population is very large. Among the billions in this world you could have married, you chose your particular spouse. You may have married for a variety of reasons. It could have been a love marriage, arranged marriage or a combination of the two. But the fact is that you are now married. It is said that ‘marriages are made in heaven’ but to maintain them, is your responsibility. You may have to work at making your marriage a success. It will not happen automatically.</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">There are some people who ‘make things happen’, others ‘talk of things that have happened’ and yet others just wonder, ‘what happened!’ You must belong to the first category. You have to make the marriage work, even when you face various challenges and problems which are given freely and generously by the world.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">Making It Happen </span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">In life we may know a lot, but doing what we know is important. ‘Knowing is not doing, doing is doing’, says Pūjya Śrī Gurudev Swami Chinmayananda.</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Sometimes outwardly a couple may look happy – partying and vacationing, but between them there is stress and conflict. Marriage should bring to your life joy, auspiciousness and well-being. All three are important. Married life must be full of joy – not just thrills – but cheer and lightness, fun and brightness. There must also be a sense of ‘well-being’ – being good and well with each other. There must also be auspiciousness – a purity and beauty in your relationship.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">Healthy and Wealthy</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">A lifestyle of simple living and high thinking brings joy and peace. Avoid extremes – indulgence or deprivation, overeating or extreme dieting, working to the bone or indolence, thinking too much or no thinking, extreme attachment or hatred. A balanced life keeps us physically and mentally healthy and health truly is our wealth. So a healthy and wealthy life does bring joy and well-being.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">Responsibility</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">The word ‘vivāha’ (marriage) comes from the Sanskrit verbal root ‘vah’ which means ‘to carry’. It means to take on the special responsibilities that go with married life.</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext"> The first responsibility is to make the marriage a success. The second responsibility is to support and take care of the immediate and extended family along with dispensing social and national responsibilities. As you perform your duties, you earn the right to enjoy the fruits of your hard work.</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">This stage of life is called the gṛhastha-āśrama literally meaning ‘dwelling at home’ (gṛha + stha). The other three stages are called brahmacarya (student life), vānaprastha (retired life) and sannyāsa (life of renunciation). In the ancient days, students lived in residential schools or colleges (gurukulas), retired people lived in forest or hermitage and the sannyāsins or monks lived in hermitages or were wandering. The householder stays at home and takes the responsibility of supporting the others and is therefore very important for the sustenance and maintenance of society.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">Secret of Successful Marriage</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">Someone remarked that everyone wants to know the secret of a successful marriage but no one knows it, since it is a very well-kept secret! However I believe that it is quite well-known but not so well practised. It is – ‘discover new love and respect for each other and let them grow each day’.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Love ‘before marriage’ is common but love ‘after marriage’ is more important. Trust strengthens love. Unobstructed by doubt and mistrust, love matures and grows. Fed by renewed feelings of tenderness, care and concern, love is nourished and blossoms. Love should never become stale and its expression gross, routine or mechanical.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">We respect the person when we see what we value in them. The more we value what others have, the more we shall respect them. Thus ever increasing mutual love and respect is the secret of a successful marriage.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">Love and Attachment</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">Attachment pollutes the pure flow of love. You should understand the difference between the two. When you love someone, you want to make the other person happy. You serve selflessly and tirelessly and take joy in loving and giving. In attachment you want to make yourself happy. Love gets polluted by demands and expectations, possessiveness, jealousy and insecurity.</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">When you love each other ‘because of’ something then if that cause goes away, the love also vanishes. A girl asked her fiancé, “Do you love me because my father will give me a lot of money?” The boy replied, “Of course not! I will love you even if your wealthy uncle will give you the money!” Real love is to love ‘in spite of’ any external circumstances or differences. Changing situations cannot rock a stable marriage anchored on mutual love. The fleeting cannot sweep away the lasting bond of true love.</span></p>


 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">The Higher Purpose of Marriage</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">We should be very clear about the goal of every action we undertake. Most of us are vague or confused about it, have given little thought to it or have superficial goals. A young boy was asked why he went to college. He said, “Without a degree, no girl will marry me!” Another person who was asked why he got married, answered, “It was not a willful act. It happened so suddenly that one day I just found myself married!”</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">The teacher asked the student in her carpentry class, what he was making. “A portable”, he replied. The confused teacher asked, “A portable what?” He said, “I have not thought about that yet. I have made a handle and everything portable has a handle!” This is like saying, “I have already got married, now let me find out its purpose”.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">The Immediate and Long Term Goals of Marriage</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">To make your marriage successful and joyful you must have an inspiring and lasting goal. The immediate goal must be geared towards something more permanent. The short term needs must lead to the fulfilment of the long term goals. For example, a student studies well to join the medical college (immediate goal) in order to become a doctor and serve mankind (long term goal).</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">For those whose immediate goal of having fun becomes their only long term and ultimate goal, their pleasures end in pressures – blood pressure, family, social and economic pressures! If marriage is only taken as a permit for licentious living or pleasure seeking without family or social responsibility, it will not be a happy marriage nor will it last. When it is geared towards something inspiring and permanent, it will bring stability, peace, growth and happiness.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Many people make New Year resolutions, particularly about losing weight and keeping fit. In early January there is a sudden increase in membership in health clubs and gyms (weight loss is a loss which is actually a gain!) but in a few days’ time the resolve dissolves and weight gain wins over weight loss. A man stood on the weighing scale one day and called out to his wife, “Come here quickly, you know all that weight that I had lost. Well, I found it here!”</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Contrast this with a person whose goal is to win a gold medal in the Olympics. He enthusiastically exercises and controls his diet on a regular and sustained basis. Since the goal is something higher, nobler and more permanent, his actions become a means to achieve it. In this case, the discipline in life is abiding and permanent and his actions and life become more meaningful and focused.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Then should not the married couple have any ambitions of material prosperity and comfort or for name, fame and power in society? Yes, you can have such immediate goals and work hard to achieve them. However the purpose of earning wealth should not be merely for your own pleasure and prosperity, but to serve others in whatever capacity you can.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Serve others through your wealth, talents and profession. One with a good voice can sing for others. A lawyer, doctor, scientist or sportsperson can benefit society through their hard work. Do not only think how much the profession can benefit you, but also think how much you can contribute to the profession, how you can serve others through your profession. Be an ideal lawyer or doctor. A still higher attitude is to make your work a worship of God, ‘service of the Lord of Lords and devotion to people as devotion to the supreme Self’ (Chinmaya Mission Pledge).</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Marriage is an opportunity to serve others. Start with your spouse and extend this service to your immediate and extended family, friends and society. Think constantly about how you can contribute to the prosperity and well-being of others. The world gives us enough opportunities to serve. Be alert and ready to serve. When service becomes your goal and a habit, your life and work become inspired, selfless and joy-giving and your mind becomes pure and peaceful. You will become less egoistic and selfish and your insistences, likes and dislikes will reduce. Such a pure mind will take you to greater heights of material and spiritual success.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">Purity of Mind</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">Why should we aim for a pure mind? A pure mind is cheerful, peaceful, alert, strong and focused. It can achieve anything and everything. It is achieved through serving others with the right attitude and following values in life. Most people have respect for values like honesty but are unable to live them. A question  arises – ‘Why should I be honest?’ If the purpose of honesty in business is to build a good reputation and attract customers, then it will last till the business has gained a reputation, after which the temptation for dishonesty will arise again. However when you realise that honesty makes me happy and dishonesty brings stress and sorrow, we will be honest not just for the immediate benefit, but for a more lasting goal, to purify our mind and prepare it for still higher goals.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="italictext">Liberation – The Ultimate Goal of Life</span></p>
 
 <p class="justify1"><span class="bodytext">In the student life our goal is to study and empower ourselves. The monk (sannyāsi) is supposed to have only a spiritual goal – seek God/Liberation. The house-holder can have material goals for fulfilling material needs and also aim to serve others. These goals prepare you with a pure mind to achieve the highest spiritual goal of Liberation.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">What is Liberation? It is freedom from all bondages. It includes freedom from the slavery to all objects, senses and the mind. Are you bound? Most of us feel we are not. We feel we can give up drinking tea any time we want to and so it is not a binding habit. But can we really? This we can test by actually giving it up. Test your attachment to watching TV by switching off and walking away from the TV in the middle of your favourite TV serial. How much you miss it, crave for it, depend on it or are possessive of it, shows how much you are attached to an object, being or situation. If you can painlessly give up (not by substituting it with another object), then you are a master and if not, you are beholden to it. Then you don’t own it, it owns you. So be a householder, but do not hold on to the house. Do not become enslaved by pleasures.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">The highest understanding of Liberation is to give up false identification with the body, senses and mind and realise the Truth – to know that I am not the perishable body but eternal and infinite Existence. This is also called God-realisation or Self-knowledge. Married life should prepare you to reach this highest goal of human life.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Sometimes people ask what svāmīs would know about married life. Someone jokingly answered that the very fact that they did not marry shows that they know. Yes, there are lots of challenges. You will have to overcome a lot of conflicts, challenges and problems that come in married life. One piece of advice may help. Make it a rule to resolve each day’s quarrels or differences before you sleep. At least agree to disagree and sleep on a positive note. Also, do not keep awake all night attempting to resolve the problem.</span></p>
 
 
 <p class="justify2"><span class="bodytext">Marriage is not just a social obligation, a familial duty, a mutual need or a legal agreement and definitely not a commercial deal. It is a sacred relationship, a coming together of two souls and two families. Do not allow any challenges and obstacles to break it and work hard to make it a success. Invoke God’s grace and Guru’s blessings for spiritual strength. Success is guaranteed with grace and right effort. God bless you all.</span></p>
