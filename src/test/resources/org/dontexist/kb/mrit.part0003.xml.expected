<p class="size6"><span class="timesb">Introduction</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">As well-known as the powerful </span><span class="pali1">Savitur Gāyatrī Mantra</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n1" href="part0003.html#ch1_no1">1</a></sup><span class="size4">, the </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span><span class="size4">inspires its chanters and reveals the Highest Spiritual Truths. Its popularity is due to the fact that it releases one from spiritual bondage and prevents untimely death. It can also ward off accidents and is said to cure even the most ‘incurable’ of diseases. That is why it is called the</span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra</span><span class="timesi">; </span><span class="pali1">mahā</span><span class="size4">means ‘great’, </span><span class="pali1">jaya</span><span class="size4">means ‘victory’, and </span><span class="pali1">mṛtyu </span><span class="size4">means ‘death’. Thus, it is that great mantra that can help us to conquer death. The </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span><span class="size4">is found in the</span><span class="pali1">Ṛg Veda </span><span class="size4">as well as in the </span><span class="pali1">Yajur Veda.</span></p>

<p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">What is a Mantra?</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Mantras are revealed truths </span><span class="pali1">(apauruṣeya)</span><span class="size4">, not concocted theories. Anything created by the limited ego, the limited being, can only be limited. Mantras are not philosophies developed by a human intellect or mind. They have been revealed to great ancient sages</span><span class="pali1">(Ṛṣis) </span><span class="size4">following their intense meditation and austerity. Therefore, mantras are classified under </span><span class="pali1">Śruti </span><span class="size4">– ‘that which was heard’. Mantras are divine revelations. The very word </span><span class="pali1">mantra </span><span class="size4">has been defined as ‘</span><span class="pali1">mananāt traiyate iti mantra</span><span class="size4">’ – ‘That which protects the one who reflects upon it’. So, the mantra protects that person who recites and reflects upon it.</span></p>

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>


<p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">Mantras are Vibrations</span></p>


<p class="just1"><span class="size4"> Mantras are not just words or sentences put together. Besides being words with deep meanings, they are also vibrations. The whole universe is nothing but vibration. Even scientifically, electrons, protons and neutrons are only energies in varying states of vibration. The entire universe is made up of energy, and this energy in different states of vibration makes up the objects of the universe. Even between people there are vibrations. How often do you hear, “He has a good vibe”, or, “We just don’t vibe with each other”. These vibrations are actually thoughts. To put it simply, sometimes our thinking processes match, and sometimes they don’t. As we think, so we are. In fact, our mind in different states of vibration produces different results or manifestations. Even things like illnesses, are often produced by our mind in a ‘dis-eased’ state of vibration. We know how our mood at any given moment colours our experience of things. Also, what brings joy to me, may bring sorrow to you, depending on our individual likes and dislikes.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Now, for two people to understand each other, they have to ‘vibe’ together. In the same way, to understand the universe, we need to ‘vibe’ with it. How did Newton discover gravity? Because of his deep enquiry, the nature of gravity revealed itself to him. Whenever our mind reaches the same frequency of any object, the complete secret of that object is revealed. Why?</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span class="timesbi">When objects vibrate at the same frequency, they merge; they unite. Per the vibration of our mind, so is the world that we experience.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">This is the principle of mantra chanting. It is a specific sound vibration that helps our mind to vibrate at a certain frequency. And, when our mind reaches that frequency, the ‘law’ of that object, or ‘essence’ of that object, is revealed. Thus mantras are very powerful vibrations and must be chanted properly. When chanted properly, they are extremely effective.</span></p>

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">Who is the Mantra Devata?</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Over a period of time when we keep chanting, the mind begins to vibrate at that frequency and, as mentioned, the mantra reveals itself or its </span><span class="pali1">devatā</span><span class="size4">. This Sanskrit word </span><span class="pali1">devatā </span><span class="size4">or </span><span class="pali1">deva</span><span class="size4">, commonly translated as ‘deity’, has been explained in many different ways. In his </span><span class="pali1">Īśāvāsya Upaniṣad </span><span class="size4">commentary, </span><span class="pali1">Śrī Ādi Śankarācārya </span><span class="size4">defines</span><span class="pali1">deva</span><span class="size4">as ‘the sentient forces governing the sense organs’. Swami Chinmayananda has very often referred to </span><span class="timesi">deva</span><span class="size4">as ‘the potential in our field of activity (commentary on </span><span class="pali1">Bhagavad Gītā </span><span class="size4">Chapter 3, verse 11). It can also mean the law or governing force of a field. All these meanings are inherent in the word </span><span class="pali1">devatā</span><span class="timesi">.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Every mantra has its own </span><span class="pali1">devatā</span><span class="size4">, its own presiding deity, so to speak, and to those who chant the mantra properly with devotion and sincerity, the mantra </span><span class="pali1">devatā </span><span class="size4">manifests. When it manifests, it blesses the chanter with the boon mentioned in the mantra. These blessings are the knowledge, the governing laws and the power invoked by that mantra. And by that knowledge, by that power, or by that </span><span class="pali1">devatā</span><span class="size4">, we are protected.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">The presiding deity of the </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra</span><span class="size4"> – that mantra which is the most powerful in conquering death – is Lord </span><span class="pali1">Śiva</span><span class="size4">, the Destroyer. It is Lord </span><span class="pali1">Śiva </span><span class="size4">in the form of </span><span class="pali1">Tryambakeśwara </span><span class="size4">– the One who has three eyes.</span></p>

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">To Whom was the Mantra Revealed?</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">The </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span><span class="size4">was revealed to none other than Sage </span><span class="pali1">Vasiṣṭa</span><span class="size4">, </span><span class="pali1">Śrī Rāmachandraji’s </span><span class="pal2">Guru</span><span class="size4">. (This is why we find </span><span class="pali1">Śrī Rāmachandrajī </span><span class="size4">worshipping Lord </span><span class="pali1">Śiva</span><span class="size4">). At that time Sage </span><span class="pali1">Vasiṣṭa </span><span class="size4">and Sage </span><span class="pali1">Viśvāmitra </span><span class="size4">were great competitors (and later on the best of friends). Because Sage </span><span class="pali1">Viśvāmitra </span><span class="size4">was always in competition with Sage </span><span class="pali1">Vasiṣṭa</span><span class="size4">, wanting to be his equal, he strove with all his might, and so to him was revealed the </span><span class="pali1">Savitur Gāyatrī Mantra</span><span class="timesi">, </span><span class="size4">while to Sage </span><span class="pali1">Vasiṣṭa </span><span class="size4">was revealed the </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra</span><span class="timesi">. </span><span class="size4">Both mantras are equally important, and both are </span><span class="pali1">mokṣadāya </span><span class="size4">mantras – meaning they can bestow spiritual liberation. It is said that the </span><span class="pali1">Gāyatrī Mantra </span><span class="size4">reveals the entire universe while the </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span><span class="size4">releases one from the universe. In this way, both mantras are really the same; when you come to know the universe, you will also know The Reality beyond the universe, and so you will be released from delusion and sorrow.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Each mantra also has its own metre </span><span class="pali1">(chanda)</span><span class="size4">. For example, </span><span class="pali1">Gāyatrī Mantra </span><span class="size4">is a type of metre. There are many </span><span class="pali1">Gāyatrī </span><span class="size4">mantras and the most famous one is the </span><span class="pali1">Savitur Gāyatrī</span><span class="size4">. This mantra, the </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra</span><span class="timesi">, </span><span class="size4">is in the </span><span class="pali1">Anuṣṭubh chanda </span><span class="size4">(metre), which has thirty-two letters in it.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4"> Generally, when you chant a mantra, you do the </span><span class="pali1">nyāsa</span><span class="size4">.  – invoking the </span><span class="pali1">Ṛṣi</span><span class="size4">, the metre </span><span class="pali1">(chanda) </span><span class="size4">and the deity </span><span class="pali1">(devatā)</span><span class="size4">. You invoke the deity in that mantra for its power and you pay respect to the metre because only by knowing the metre can you chant the mantra properly. So you start by invoking your own Guru, then Sage</span><span class="pali1">Vasiṣṭa</span><span class="size4">, to get the blessings of the </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra</span><span class="size4">.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">However, besides the Guru, the deity and the metre, a mantra also has a feminine force or </span><span class="pali1">Śakti </span><span class="size4">behind it. This is the power that guides it or gives it direction. </span><span class="pali1">Amṛteśwari</span><span class="size4">, the giver of </span><span class="pali1">Amṛtam </span><span class="size4">(immortality), is the </span><span class="pali1">Devi </span><span class="size4">(goddess) behind the </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra</span><span class="size4">.</span></p>

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>

 
<p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">Simple Meaning</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Mantras are capsules. In medicine, capsules can be very small and look quite harmless, but once they burst open there is usually a lot of medication within. So, too, when you internalise the </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra</span><span class="size4">. When you contemplate on it, it may burst open to reveal a tremendous amount of meaning. It mushrooms in its message, almost like an atomic explosion!</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4"> Now if we look at the different dimensions of this mantra’s meaning, confusion may arise. So, first we will look at the simple meaning of this mantra, and then explore its deeper implications.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="pali1">Tryambakam</span><span class="timesi">– The One with three eyes, Lord </span><span class="pali1">Śiva</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="pali1">Yajāmahe</span><span class="timesi">– I worship, I sacrifice </span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="pali1">Sugandhim</span><span class="size4">– </span><span class="timesi">Who is fragrant </span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="pali1">Puṣṭivardhanam </span><span class="size4">– </span><span class="timesi">Who makes you grow</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="pali1">Urvārukam iva Bandhanāt </span><span class="size4">– </span><span class="timesi">Just as a ripe cucumber is freed from its bondage to the creeper</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="pali1">Mṛtyor </span><span class="size4">– </span><span class="timesi">from death</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="pali1">Mukṣīya </span><span class="size4">– </span><span class="timesi">May I be liberated</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="pali1">Mā’mṛtāt</span><span class="size4">– </span><span class="timesi">not from Immortality</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Thus a complete translation would be:</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="timesi">‘I worship the Three-eyed One (Lord </span><span class="pali1">Śiva</span><span class="timesi">), who is fragrant and makes us grow. Like the ripe cucumber (that is freed effortlessly) from bondage, may I too be released from mortality. May I never be distanced from Immortality.’</span></p>

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="size6"><span class="timesb">Why Victory over Death?<br class="calibre5"/>What is Death?</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">The </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span><span class="size4">is known as the mantra that gives victory over death. What, then, is death? Generally we think of physical death, but in fact there are many types of death.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Birth, in a funny way, is really the beginning of death. The moment you are born, you have actually started dying! We know through our studies that when the body dies, the </span><span class="pali1">jīva </span><span class="size4">or ‘soul’ moves on to another body. Therefore birth and death are two sides of a coin; you cannot have one without the other. Birth is the beginning of a new state, which means the death of a previous state. We cannot speak of one without the other. Hence, birth itself is death. And when we celebrate birthdays, what are we celebrating? Years which are dead. That’s why we blow out rather than light the candles on our birthday cake.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Change is also a form of death. Scientifically, we know nothing in the universe is destroyed; it only changes its form. Even if the body perishes to become ashes, those ashes become nourishment for plants, and the plants become food for animals and humans. Everything in nature is recycled. That which seems to perish, is reborn in another form.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4"> If death, in effect, is the culmination of a state of ongoing birth and change, then change by the very same fact can also be considered death. And, from moment to moment, change is taking place – your childhood died for your youth to be born, your youth died for your adulthood to begin, and so on. This change is taking place at every moment at every level of your being – physical, emotional and intellectual.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">The </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span><span class="size4">helps us to recognise and manage this change. Today in business management there is what is called ‘change management’, because people keep changing jobs. And don’t you have to manage people in your house who are constantly changing as well? Learning to manage change, then, is really a matter of learning to manage death. Change is death of what preceded it. Conversely, death is simply change.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Misery, too, is death. When a change seems to be conducive to us, we forget it is death. When the share market, for example, goes up, people are happy, but when it comes crashing down, people become miserable. In some there is an almost fundamental change in their mindset and lifestyle. So, misery, a negative change, is also a form of death.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Does anyone really want death or misery? Obviously not, but everything we want, desire, hold on to, get attached to and live with, will one day change and give us misery. Change or death is inevitable. Nobody really wants a life of misery. It seems, however, that everything we want will at some stage make us miserable.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">If someone is living an unproductive life, a life in which that person is just lazy, you often hear people say, ‘That person is as good as dead.’ Other people may be brain-damaged or disabled, some of them may even look dead, yet often they use whatever abilities they have to produce an amazing life.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Agitation or sin is also death. Death is that which destroys or ends, and therefore, all those things or actions that destroy us, our peace, and our happiness, can be seen as death. Living a life of sin, of evil, which is destructive to ourselves and to others, is death.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">By extension, dishonour is a living death. Lord Krishna in the </span><span class="pali1">Bhagavad Gītā </span><span class="size4">says to Arjuna, ‘For those who have lived a noble life and who have attained fame, for them, dishonour is death </span><span class="pali1">(Sambhāvitasya cākirtiḥ maraṇād atiricyate)</span><span class="size4">.’</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n2" href="part0003.html#ch1_no2">2</a></sup><span class="size4"> Would you be able to face the death of your fame? Interestingly, in the Japanese culture of the past, when their honour was lost, they would perform harakiri (suicide).</span></p>



<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Severe illness similarly causes pain and misery. Those who are very ill and incapacitated may even want euthanasia. For those who have such an illness, living is very difficult. Their illness either leads to physical death or is itself a form of death. Thus when you say, </span><span class="pali1">Mṛtyor Mukṣīya</span><span class="size4">, you are actually saying, ‘Please free me from all this that is called death.’</span></p>
 
<div class="bor"></div>
<div class="just3"><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_no2" href="part0003.html#ch1_n2">2</a></sup><span class="pali2">Bhagavad Gītā – 2.34</span></div>

 
 

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">Even when things are favourable, the fear of change is always there. There is a saying, ‘Fear itself is death’, and for one who lives in constant fear, tension, and anxiety, this mantra releases them from all such pains and sorrows. When we are living under stress, we do not love or enjoy life; there is a constant fear. The threat of change, whether real or imagined, causes fear, and that renders our life a virtual death-in-progress. We know from our studies that there is no real death, but it is fear itself which is the death element.</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">There are so many meanings to be derived from the word </span><span class="pali1">mṛtyu </span><span class="size4">or ‘death’ in this mantra. We have many fears and, as we have seen, death can present itself to us in many ways. The </span><span class="pali1">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span><span class="size4">helps us overcome death and gives us freedom from misery, illness and the fear of change.</span></p>
 
<p class="just1"><span class="timesbi1">From this </span><span class="pali1">mṛtyu</span><span class="timesi">, </span><span class="timesbi1">‘death’, O Lord, </span><span class="pali1">mukṣīya</span><span class="timesi">, </span><span class="timesbi1">‘may I be liberated’.</span></p>

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p> 
 
<p class="just2"><span class="timesb1"> Tryambakam</span></p>

<p class="just1"><span class="size4">The word </span><span class="pali1">Tryambakam </span><span class="size4">has many beautiful meanings. Simply put, it is ‘The One with three Eyes’ – Lord </span><span class="pali1">Śiva</span><span class="size4">! The three eyes of the Lord are:</span></p>
<ol class="size8">
<li value="1" class="calibre6"><span> the eye of justice;</span></li>

<li value="2" class="calibre6"><span> the eye of compassion; and</span></li>

<li value="3" class="calibre6"><span>  the eye of wisdom.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="size6"><span class="timesi1">The Eye of Justice</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Since the Lord is the giver of the fruits of our actions, He has to judge or see very clearly every action that is done by us and ensure that the right fruit goes to the right person. Now, when we think like this, we tend to think of God as a stern and mighty Being who is ever ready to punish us. However, this is not the case. The fruit of our action is nothing but the result of our action. It is our action itself that bears fruit. But action by nature is inert, so how can it judge and give us any fruit? There must be a sentient being involved, and that sentient entity that presides over the dispensation of all fruits of actions must be Omniscient – all-knowing. This is the Lord – the <span class="pali">Karmaphala dātā</span> (Giver of the fruits of actions). This is something that must be pondered to be understood. The Lord gives us the fruits of action according to the natural laws of action and reaction. So, per your action, you get the corresponding fruit.</span></p> 

<p class="size7"><span>We must understand, however, that no fruit or reaction comes to us as a punishment<span class="timesb2">. </span>When a reaction to an action occurs, and that reaction is painful, it is simply trying to tell us not to act in this manner. For example, when you lie down and try to read a book, and after a while your arms start hurting. The pain is not a punishment, it is not a curse, it is just pointing out to you that you are performing the wrong action. Correct it! When we say that the Lord has the eye of justice, as a corollary it must be admitted that He also has the eye of correction, not punishment.</span></p>




<p class="size7"><span class="timesbi">Every action has a reaction, so if you do not want a certain reaction you must not act in a certain way.</span></p>

<p class="size6"><span class="timesi1">The Eye of Compassion</span></p>


<p class="size7"><span>Sometimes the ‘judgement’ or reaction may seem harsh, and we cry out for compassion. The Lord’s second eye is, necessarily, the eye of love and compassion (for He would be limited, and extremely un-Godly, otherwise). When we have to manage people, we cannot be only critical, nor can we be too emotional, or people may take advantage of us. Our critical judgement should be softened by our compassion. There has to be a balance of judgement and compassion. Similarly, these are the two eyes of the Lord: one of justice, and the other of love and compassion.</span></p> 

 

<p class="size6"><span class="timesi1">The Eye of Wisdom</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>What is this third eye? Often we see pictures of Lord <span class="pali">Śiva </span>with a third eye on His forehead. However, opening the third eye is not about doing some acupuncture or operation to your forehead to uncover a fleshy eye beneath. The centre of the forehead, just between the two eyebrows, is the centre of concentration. Whenever we think intensely, whenever we want to remember something, our concentration gathers in this place. Therefore it is the centre of our knowledge.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Where do you feel love? You feel love in your heart, don’t you? From where do you think? You never think from your stomach. You may think about your stomach, but you do not think from it. Each emotion has a corresponding centre or place in the body. Where do you feel fear? Generally, it is in the stomach. Even when you say you are sick, you say, ‘sick in the stomach’. And whenever we talk about thinking, we always refer to the head. The head is as if the repository of our thinking, and the eye of wisdom is the centre where knowledge takes place.</span></p> 

<p class="size7"><span>The Lord’s third eye is thus the eye of wisdom and knowledge. There is a beautiful prayer: ‘Oh Lord, help me to change what I can change, help me to accept what I can’t change and give me the wisdom to know the difference between the two.’ When we meditate upon the Lord, we close our two fleshy eyes and focus on the so-called third eye, because of the knowledge and wisdom that we lack. We meditate upon the ‘Lord with three eyes’ to invoke the wisdom of Lord <span class="pali">Śiva</span>.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>What is this wisdom? It is that faculty that helps us see beyond the obvious. When the mind is chaste, calm and concentrated, then the pure intellect appears. The mind in a state of <span class="timesb2">quietude manifests that intellect which is</span> illumined.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Take, for example, a glass of water with a spoon in it. Your physical eye will see a spoon that is bent. Scientifically we know this is due to the refraction of light in different mediums. In a denser medium light travels slower, so in water it travels slower than in air. Thus you see one part of the spoon earlier and one part of the spoon later and the spoon appears to be broken. If you want to frighten a child, just ask him to put a spoon in the water and say, ‘Hey, look, you have broken it!’ and the child will get frightened because what he sees, he believes. But you know the spoon is not bent even though you see it apparently bent. This is your eye of wisdom or knowledge. The illumined intellect is also capable of gaining knowledge that is beyond the boundaries of perception. This is what some people call intuition.</span></p> 

<p class="size7"><span>When we survey the universe at this moment, we see the complete changing mirage of this world and we consider it to be permanent, that it will always be there, because we perceive it so. However, with which eye can we recognise that the world is relative and only an appearance? Using our day-to-day language we may say we need ‘The Eye of Einstein’. And what is that Eye of Einstein? It is that knowledge or vision that Einstein used to recognise the universe and its inherent yet apparently secret laws. In the same way, He is the Lord who sees beyond Creation to the Eternal with His ‘eye of knowledge’. The <span class="pali">Vedas </span>proclaim ‘One who knows the Eternal becomes the Eternal <span class="pali">(Brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati)</span>.’<sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n3" href="part0003.html#ch1_no3">3</a></sup> Thus <span class="pali">Tryambakam </span>is ‘the One who is Eternal’.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>There is another meaning to the word <span class="pali">Tryambakam</span>: In Sanskrit, <span class="pali">amba </span>also means ‘father’, or ‘Lord’, so <span class="pali">Tri-amba </span>means the ‘Father or Lord of the Three’. Now, in our scriptures there are many combinations of three’s. One is the three <span class="pali">pura </span>or ‘worlds’ – earth, heaven and hell. So <span class="pali">Tryambakam </span>in this sense means ‘Lord of the three worlds.’</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n4" href="part0003.html#ch1_no4">4</a></sup></p>

<p class="size7"><span>There are also our three states of experience: the waking, dream and deep-sleep states. In these three states we experience different worlds. The one underlying substratum of these three states is Pure Consciousness <span class="pali">(Cit)</span>. Therefore Tryambakam <span>as Pure Consciouness</span> is also ‘The Lord of the waking, dream and deep-sleep states’.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>The figure three can also indicate the three bodies: gross (physical), subtle (conscious mind) and causal (subconscious mind).

<p class="size7"><span>Lord <span class="pali">Śiva </span>is also called <span class="pali">Tripurāri </span>– Vanquisher of the demon <span class="pali">Tripurāsura</span>. There is the wonderful story of this demon who lived in three cities. Each city was different: one was of gold, the other of silver and the third of iron. The cities were like aircraft and could not be destroyed until and unless they were aligned in a specific way. It was at that time Lord <span class="pali">Śiva </span>pierced through the three cities simultaneously, destroying them and the demon as well. This symbolises that He is the destroyer of the ego and its delusory identification with the three bodies. Because of this victory, He is called <span class="pali">Jaya </span>(Victorious One) and, specifically, <span class="pali">Mṛtyuñjaya</span>.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>There is yet another way to look at <span class="pali">Tryambakam</span>. As a word it is made up of three components: <span class="pali">Tri </span><span class="timesi2">+ </span><span class="pali">amba</span> <span class="timesi2">+ </span><span class="pali">kam</span>. The meanings of the first two words have been discussed already, and to these is added <span class="pali">kam</span>. In Sanskrit <span class="pali">kam</span> is classified as an indeclinable word (ie has no inflected form). Thus <span class="pali">Tryambakam</span> can also imply that the Lord of the three changing worlds is Himself changeless and immutable. Also, from the <span class="pali">Chāndogya Upaniṣad </span>we know that <span class="pali">kam </span>means ‘the Bliss of the Eternal – <span class="pali">Brahman (kam Brahma-sukham)</span>.’</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n7" href="part0003.html#ch1_no7">7</a></sup></p>
 
<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>
 
<p class="size6"><span class="timesb">Yajāmahe</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span><span class="pali">Yajāmahe </span>means to ‘worship’, ‘sacrifice’ and ‘adore’. We worship, admire and are ready to sacrifice for someone who is greater than us, and being the Lord of the three worlds, and the bestower of Eternity, He is certainly worthy of our worship.<span class="timesb2"> To that alone we are able to </span> surrender. <span class="timesb2">So, when we use the word</span> <span class="pali">yajā </span>or <span class="pali">yajāmahe</span> , what exactly are we ready to sacrifice, how are we to worship, and what do we mean by adoration?</span></p>


<p class="size7"><span>When we understand God to be the Supreme Being, and that from Him alone the entire universe has manifested, then to such a Lord we must express our gratitude. It is from Him alone that we have received everything. </span></p>
 

 <div class="bor"></div>

<div class="just3"><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_no7" href="part0003.html#ch1_n7">7</a></sup><span class="sans1">कं ब्रह्म</span><span class="pali2">(Chāndogya Upaniṣad- 4.10.4)</span></div>
 
 
 
<p class="size7"><span>But when we say gratitude, do we mean God wants our ‘thank you’? Even our parents don’t want our ‘thank you’. ‘Thank you’ is not really said for the giver, it is actually for the benefit of the receiver. When we express our gratitude, we are acknowledging the blessings we have received. </span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>We may have somehow gained something, but if we do not acknowledge it, then we have never really gained it. For example, you have bought a lottery ticket and somebody tells you that you have won the lottery. But you don’t believe it, you refuse to acknowledge it. Do you feel any richer then? If we do not acknowledge what we have gained, then we have never really received or appreciated it. And that which we haven’t appreciated we cannot really enjoy.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>When there is a sense of gratitude, a feeling that, ‘I have received so much, I appreciate it, I acknowledge and have enjoyed it’, then out of such gratitude we express our feeling of love. And love always expresses itself as giving and sharing. You cannot say, ‘I love you, but I don’t want to give you anything.’ When you love, then giving becomes spontaneous, it becomes natural. And therefore <span class="pali">yajā </span>also means ‘to offer’. What we have already received we offer or share. That’s why after every worship, whatever we receive in the form of consecrated food <span class="pali">(prasād) </span>we accept with gratitude to the Lord and then we share it.</span></p>
 
 
 
<p class="size7"><span>By sharing we experience a joy far greater than the joy of receiving. Receiving has its joy, certainly, but it is not as great as that of sharing. This is clearly seen with food. All of us love eating, and when somebody offers us food, we eat, and we definitely enjoy it. But when you cook food, you enjoy it even more when others eat it! Imagine cooking your favourite dish and nobody else eats it! Does that give you joy? True fulfilment is in the sharing. This spirit of sharing is called <span class="pali">yajña</span>. So when we have received something from the Lord, we first offer it to the Lord, out of gratitude.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Also, by sharing what we have, we diminish our attachment to it. Anything that we are attached to binds us, because attachment itself is bondage. How does it bind us? We become dependent on it. However, when we share with the feeling that, ‘I have received this from the Lord’, then there is no clinging, there is no feeling of ‘This is mine alone’. Therefore <span class="pali">yajña </span>is the greatest purifier.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Sharing is also an investment. It brings about greater productivity because what we invest comes back to us. In the <span class="pali">Bhagavad Gītā </span>it is said, ‘Having created the world in the spirit of sacrifice and sharing, the Creator said, “By this shall you prosper” <span class="pali">(Sahayajñāḥ prajāḥ sṛṣṭvā purovāca prajāpatiḥ anena prasaviṣyadhvam eṣa vo’stviṣṭakāmadhuk)</span>.’</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n8" href="part0003.html#ch1_no8">8</a></sup></p>

<div class="just3"><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_no8" href="part0003.html#ch1_n8">8</a></sup><span class="pali2">Bhagavad Gītā – 3.10</span></div>
 
 
 
<p class="size7"><span>When parents create a nursery or playhouse for their children, is it really for themselves or for their children? Evidently it is because the children want it, and when the children want to play, the mother also has to set the rules of the game. The mother says, ‘If you’ll share with each other, you can play.’ And when the children share their toys and play together with a team spirit, naturally they have lots of fun and they enjoy with all their giggling and laughter. But when they become selfish, and one says, ‘No, this is <span class="timesi2">my </span> toy’, and then the other child wants that toy, too, even though there may be many other toys, then they start fighting. It is like that in the world, too, is it not? There are so many things available to us, but no, we always seem to want what others have. When we become selfish like this, our energies become dissipated in stress and conflict, and we make our lives miserable and stop being productive. Once we stop being productive, we stop being prosperous.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Therefore, start sharing now! There are many people who say to me, ‘Swamiji, please bless me, I am starting a new business, and if I make good money then I will donate to the Mission.’ The problem is they never make enough to donate! They have to pay off their mortgages, buy new cars, then they have a family to look after... it just never ends. It is from whatever we have, that we should start donating. People wait in the hope that they will make millions before donating, then they will share, then they will offer... But if one doesn’t invest in the spirit of <span class="pali">yajña </span>now, then those millions will never come!</span></p>
 

<p class="size7"><span>When there is sharing, when there is cooperation, then there is a spirit of dedication, sacrifice and service. There is not only enjoyment and great prosperity but at the same time there is peace of mind. As Lord <span class="pali">Kṛṣṅa</span> has said, ‘Thus nourishing one another you will attain the Highest Good <span class="pali">(Parasparam Bhāvayantaḥ Śreyaḥ Param Avāpsyatha)</span>.’</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n9" href="part0003.html#ch1_no9">9</a></sup></p>

<p class="size7"><span>So, there is not just enjoyment but there is also self-development. In the <span class="pali">yajña </span>offering we say, ‘O Sun, I have received from you warmth, as well as fertility of the soil, and so I offer to you what I have produced’, ‘I offer to you what is not mine <span class="pali">(Svāhā idam na mama)</span>.’ Also in the <span class="pali">Ārati </span>(worship) we chant, ‘I offer to You what is Yours <span class="pali">(Terā tujhko arpaṅ)</span>.’ By doing this our ego is quelled and where there is no ego, there is no selfishness; there is surrender and attunement with our Higher Nature, God.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Giving up our ego is true sacrifice, true surrender. Otherwise, what are we giving up? We can only offer the Lord what He doesn’t have – all of our negativities and selfish desires which form our ego. In the highest sense <span class="pali">yajña </span> therefore means ‘to surrender our ego’.</span></p>


<div class="bor"></div>
<div class="just3"><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_no9" href="part0003.html#ch1_n9">9</a></sup><span class="pali2">Bhagavad Gītā – 3.11</span></div>



<p class="size7"><span>And how will we surrender our ego? It is not easy. But when we recognise that He is the Lord of the three worlds and that everything is happening because of Him, when we extol Him, when we glorify and praise Him, we realise how insignificant we are in whatever we have achieved. Then only can we be grateful, and it is then that a natural surrender takes place. With this gratitude, the more we see the greatness of the Cause of Creation, God, the more complete becomes our surrender. Therefore, praise the Lord: ‘Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, worship Govinda <span class="pali">(Bhaja Govindam</span><span class="timesi2">,</span> <span class="pali">Bhaja Govindam</span><span class="timesi2">, Govindam Bhaja mūḍhamate)</span>!’</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n10" href="part0003.html#ch1_no10">10</a></sup></p>

 
<p class="size7"><span>What is ‘adoration’? Whatever you admire or adore, you praise. You keep talking about it. Your children or grandchildren, for instance, you love them and you love to talk about them.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>In whatever we do, whoever is present in our midst, we must praise the Truth, we must praise God, we must praise this knowledge we have gained and we must praise our Guru. We <span class="timesi2">must </span>do that, because the more we do it, the greater is our surrender. It is not that people don’t do it; all of us do it in some way or the other, but it should be done <span class="timesi2">even </span>more. It is time to practise what we have learnt. Hence, loud <span class="pali">kīrtan </span>(devotional singing) should be done. That said, greater <span class="pali">kīrtan </span>occurs when you glorify the Lord for <span class="timesi2">all </span>of your achievements. It is through our actions and our words that people should admire us. And when they ask, ‘What is the secret of your success, your greatness?’, we can proudly say as <span class="pali">Hanumānjī </span>did: ‘I am the servant of Lord <span class="pali">Rām (Rāma dūta mein)</span>.’ Wherever we go, we are devotees of the Lord.</span></p>

<div class="just3"><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_no10" href="part0003.html#ch1_n10">10</a></sup><span class="pali2">Bhaja Govindam – 1</span></div>
 
 
<p class="size7"><span>True glorification of the Lord, nevertheless, is emulation. That which you admire, you become. Be Godly in your actions, be Godly in your speech, be Godly in your behaviour, be Godly in your giving, be forgiving in your transactions – be Godly! <span class="timesi2">That </span>is true praise of the Lord, <span class="timesi2">that </span>is real attunement with the Divine, <span class="timesi2">that </span>is <span class="pali">yajāmahe</span><span class="timesi2">.</span></span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>So, whatever we have, we should share it in the name of the Lord. Since He is the Lord of the three worlds and pervades everything, sharing or serving Him means serving His Creation. When we serve people, we shouldn’t do for only the poor, thinking, ‘Oh, what a pitiable person’. Whoever we are looking after, he or she is none other than the Lord, whether He is in a sick, poor, rich or needy form.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Of course, the most basic form of worship is when we sit in front of a picture or an idol remembering the Lord and expressing our gratitude, and whatever remains of our offering, we share as <span class="pali">prasād</span>. Another form is wherein whatever we have in our day-to-day life, whether it is our knowledge, love, wealth or even just our smile, we share it with others, remembering that this whole world is a manifestation of the Lord. After all, He pervades the three worlds. Thus, in the words of Swami Chinmayananda, ‘Service of the people is service of the Lord of Lords.’<sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n11" href="part0003.html#ch1_no11">11</a></sup> That is <span class="pali">yajāmahe</span>.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>How, then, should we serve? We can only serve with what we have and what we are capable of doing. Therefore when we perform our duties with an attitude of service, this becomes <span class="pali">karma yoga </span>– also called <span class="pali">yajña</span>. In such actions, our existing <span class="pali">vāsanās </span>(binding subconscious impressions) are exhausted, and our clinging attachments are all removed by the Grace of the Lord. Not only do we become more productive, but more importantly, our mind also gets purified and we become more attuned with the Lord.</span></p>
 
<p class="size7"><span class="timesbi">He is of the nature of Immutable Bliss and is Eternal. He is worthy of worship –</span><span class="palbi">Yajāmahe</span><span class="timesb2">.</span></p>

 <p class="size6"><span class="timesb">Amba – Invoking Power (</span><span class="palb1">Ś</span><span class="timesb">akti)</span></p>
 
 <p class="size7"><span>We have seen that in the word </span><span class="pali">Tryambakam</span><span class="timesi2">, </span><span class="pali">amba</span><span>means ‘father’. But </span><span class="pali">amba </span><span>can also mean ‘mother’ in Sanskrit when it is taken in the vocative case. If we take the word </span><span class="pali">amba </span><span>as ‘mother’, we can derive another beautiful meaning: ‘One who has the three </span><span class="pali">śaktis</span><span>or Powers’. What are the three </span><span class="pali">śaktis</span><span>? They are </span><span class="pali">jñana śakti </span><span>– the power of knowledge, </span><span class="pali">icchā śakti</span><span>– the power of will or desire, and </span><span class="pali">kriyā śakti </span><span>– the power of action. All these three powers are required for us to achieve anything in this world.</span></p>

<div class="just3"><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_no11" href="part0003.html#ch1_n11">11 </a></sup><span class="times">Chinmaya Mission Pledge</span></div>
 

<p class="size7"><span>First of all, we must have knowledge of the ‘field’ – our environment and our goal. Then we must have the motivation – the desire to perform or to achieve. We must also have the strength and ability as well as the talent and energy to perform the action. Thus we need all these three mighty <span class="pali">śaktis</span> which are personified by the three goddesses – <span class="pali">Sarasvatī (jñana)</span><span class="timesi2">, </span><span class="pali">Lakṣmī (icchā) </span>and <span class="pali">Durgā (kriyā).</span></span></p>

<p class="size7"><span><span class="pali">Yajāmahe </span> thus means to invoke, as in ‘I invoke these three mighty powers from the One who has them –<span class="pali">Tryambakam</span>’. How exactly do we invoke? By trying to gain knowledge of this Truth, we invoke <span class="pali">jñana śakti</span>. <span class="pali">Icchā śakti </span>implies ‘I should be desirous of It’, which calls for <span class="pali">bhakti </span>(devotion). And <span class="pali">kriyā śakti </span>flows in when we perform an action correctly, making it <span class="pali">karma yoga</span>.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>With a mind prepared by <span class="pali">bhakti </span>and <span class="pali">karma yoga</span>, we enquire into the Ultimate Truth<span class="timesi2">. </span>In that enquiry of the Infinite, when the ego is dissolved, then there is only one indivisible reality. This is the highest form of sacrifice, this is <span class="pali">yajā</span>, where the ego is sacrificed in the fire of knowledge.</span></p>
 
 
<p class="size7"><span>We have to apply <span class="timesi2">this </span>to our daily life to invoke the Lord’s blessing, to invoke His power. This is not just for us to understand and feel inspired. Constant enquiry into the nature of ‘Truth’ is necessary, as it leads us to realisation of our oneness with the Universe and the Lord.</span></p>
 


<p class="size7"><span>Devotion is Love, so desire the Truth in such a way that you are ready to give up <span class="timesi2">anything </span> for this Love. In Love there is surrender and acceptance. Love also expresses itself as service or sharing, and so there is <span class="pali">kriyā </span>–action.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>In the <span class="pali">Bhagavad Gītā</span><span class="timesi2">, </span>Lord <span class="pali">Kṛṣṇa </span>says, ‘Of all <span class="pali">yajñas</span>, I am <span class="pali">japa yajña (Yajñanām japayajño’smi)</span>.’<sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n12" href="part0003.html#ch1_no12">12</a></sup> What is <span class="pali">japa yajña</span>? <span class="pali">Japa </span>is constant remembrance. Thus the repetition of this mantra, which constantly reminds us of Him, He who is the Lord of the three worlds, who awakens knowledge and devotion within us and because of whom we have the ability to act and achieve, is called <span class="pali">japa.</span></span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Indeed, what can we offer the Lord who has given us everything? Our offering or gratitude can only be in the form of remembrance. Think of your wedding anniversary. What else does a wife really want? In the initial few years she might want some gift, but ultimately, the fact that you remembered is enough! What keeps us away from the Lord is only our mind, our thoughts. To illustrate, you might be on holiday with your partner, but if your thoughts are somewhere else, then your partner will complain, ‘You’re always so distant. What’s the use of going on holiday if your mind is always in the office?’</span></p>

What is a good fragrance? It is an aroma that is agreeable, pleasant, uplifting. Have you noticed that the moment you encounter a particular smell, a past incident immediately comes to mind? When you smell vanilla, for instance, it gives you a good feeling because it brings back memories of those lovely ice-creams that mummy and daddy fed you, or the cake that your mother or grandmother used to bake. Your memory is as closely associated with smell as with sight. So, by saying He is fragrant, it is pointing out that the Lord, <span class="pali">Tryambakam</span>, is well remembered; He is ‘famous’ or ‘well known’.</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n14" href="part0003.html#ch1_no14">14</a></sup></p>

<p class="size7"><span>If you look at the world, you cannot but see the Creator. He is all-pervasive. <span class="pali">Sugandhim </span>also implies joy. If you look at the whole of Creation, it is nothing but joy. God created the world; there is no misery. We make our own misery by not seeing a situation for what it is. ‘But what about the 2004 tsunami?’ you may say. What a beautiful phenomenon a tsunami is – scientifically viewed. As long as your own house is not in it, it is not a problem. In truth we suffer mainly because of our ‘mine-ness’ in a situation.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Fragrance is also that which spreads. Whenever you light incense or offer certain flowers at an altar or shrine, their fragrance radiates to eventually pervade the entire room.

<p class="size7"><span><span class="pali">Puṣṭivardhanam </span>is also an adjective for the Lord, <span class="pali">Tryambakam. Vardhanam </span>means to grow’ or ‘increase’, while <span class="pali">puṣṭi </span>means ‘nourishment’. <span class="pali">Puṣṭivardhanam </span>therefore means ‘One who nourishes growth’. There are many beautiful meanings to the word <span class="pali">puṣṭi </span>– ‘to nourish’, ‘to vitalise’ and ‘magnificence’. <span class="pali">Puṣṭi </span>also means ‘welfare’, ‘well-being’ and ‘prosperity’.</span></p> 
 
<p class="size7"><span>So how does the Lord nourish our growth? When we chant this mantra correctly, the vibrations themselves help to tune our mind to a more peaceful wavelength. Coupled with intellectual understanding, the mantra helps to raise our thoughts to a Higher Ideal, facilitating the removal of low and petty mental agitations. Hence, <span class="pali">Puṣṭivardhanam</span> is He who bestows on us or increases our virtues and positive tendencies while destroying our vices and negative tendencies. By this He brings about magnificence and well-being <span class="pali">(niśreyasam) </span>as well as prosperity <span class="pali">(abhyudayaḥ) </span>– the very goals of <span class="pali">dharma</span><span class="timesi2">.</span></span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>It is very interesting that in the <span class="pali">Śiva Mahāpurāṇam</span>, the <span class="pali">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span>was revealed by Lord <span class="pali">Śiva </span>to <span class="pali">Śukrācārya</span>, the Guru of the <span class="pali">Asurās</span>. <span class="pali">Asurās </span>are those who indulge their senses. <span class="pali">Śukrācārya </span>was a great Guru, for the Guru who can take people with materialistic outlooks to higher ideals certainly faces a challenge only few can handle.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span><span class="pali">Puṣṭi</span> additionally means ‘generator’, ‘progenitor’ or ‘producer’. He alone is the Creator of the entire universe. The One who has created the universe is also nourishing it. It is into Him as well that it will dissolve. Thus it is said that He alone is <span class="pali">Brahmā</span><span class="timesi2">, </span><span class="pali">Viṣṇu</span> and <span class="pali">Maheśwara</span> – the Creator, Sustainer and Destroyer.</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n15" href="part0003.html#ch1_no15">15</a></sup></p> 
 
<div class="bor"></div>
<div class="just3"><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_no15" href="part0003.html#ch1_n15">15</a> </sup><span class="sans1">विष्णोृगतष पितामहस्यापि मुनीनां च महामुने। इन्द्रियाणां च देवानां तस्माद्वै पुष्टिवर्धनृगतष॥</span><span class="times">‘O Great Sage!

<p class="size7"><span>What is that which nourishes all? What is that which drives, sustains and provides us with the energy to perform all our activities in life? It is happiness. It is for happiness alone that we live, breathe, eat, sleep and achieve. And not just any happiness; we seek permanent happiness. <span class="pali">Puṣṭivardhanam </span>is that Absolute, Unbroken Happiness also known as <span class="pali">Ānanda</span>.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span class="timesbi">Thus the</span><span class="palbi">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span><span class="timesbi">is a mantra that triumphs over all materialism, while bestowing prosperity as well.</span></p> 

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">Urvarukam Iva</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span><span class="pali">Urvārukam iva Bandhanāt Mṛtyor Mukṣīya </span>means ‘May I be released from this bondage called death, just as the cucumber’. Cucumbers or melons are fruits which grow on creepers or vines. A fully grown cucumber is called <span class="pali">urvārukam</span>. Just as a ripe cucumber is easily severed or detached from the creeper, in the same manner, ‘O Lord, effortlessly free me from bondage to this <span class="pali">samsāra </span>(world of plurality, delusion, sorrow)’. The world as we know it is also like a creeper; it not only creeps up on you, but also clings to you. But a ripe cucumber is easily detached from the creeper. That is why our <span class="pali">Ṛṣis </span>say we should never pick an unripe fruit – because it hurts the plant. With a ripe fruit, however, you just touch it and it comes off into your hand. In a similar vein we pray: ‘Let my attachment to the universe fall off me effortlessly.’</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>What is this ripening? Ripening is growth, fitness for a particular purpose, and any fruit that is ripe can be easily plucked. We also know that no spiritual knowledge is possible without dispassion <span class="pali">(vairāgya)</span>, and without knowledge <span class="pali">(jñāna)</span>, there is no liberation. In the <span class="pali">Rāma Gītā </span>there is the statement: ‘By living a righteous life, dispassion evolves, dispassion leads to single-pointedness and from this, true knowledge arises, and from knowledge, liberation <span class="pali">(Dharma te birati joga te gyāna</span><span class="timesi2">, </span><span class="pali">gyāna mocchaprada beda bakhāna).’</span></span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n16" href="part0003.html#ch1_no16">16</a></sup></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Living a life of duty and righteousness will result in our growing out of our clinging dependence on the things and beings of the world. Therefore we ripen, and that which ripens becomes sweet. What is the sign of your spiritual progress? Not for people to think, ‘What a horrible person, always temperamental, moody or withdrawn.’ People should find you sweet because you ask for nothing, have nothing to take, nothing to grieve over. You live only to give. Having gone through the experience of the world, you have now had enough of the world. ‘Take me, free me!’ Free me from what? Freedom from the world is nothing but freedom from change and freedom from death.</span></p> 
 
 
<div class="bor"></div>
<div class="just3"><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_no16" href="part0003.html#ch1_n16">16</a></sup><span class="pali2">Śrī Rāmacaritamānasa Araṇya Kāṇḍa – Doha 15, Chaupai 1</span></div> 

<p class="size7"><span>There is also another implication in the simile cited earlier. There are some fruits that fall from the tree that bears them, and when they fall they get bruised. However, the cucumber vine generally grows on the ground and when the fruit is ripe, the stalk that binds it to the plant dries out, but the fruit obviously does not fall from a distance. While the cucumber does not get damaged this way, it still has to be picked at the right time or it will start decaying in the field or drop its seeds and produce unhealthy competition. Similarly, we too need a gardener in life to come and ‘pluck’ us before we decay. Who is that gardener? It is Lord <span class="pali">Śiva </span>in the form of the Guru, the Guru <span class="pali">Tattva </span>(principle).</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span class="timesbi">Therefore unto that Guru we chant, ‘O One with three eyes! O Enlightened One! Just as the ripe fruit is effortlessly plucked, please liberate me from this creeper of the world of <span class="palbi">samsāra </span>which has entangled me.</span></p>

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>
 
 <p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">Arukam – Disease </span></p> 
 
<p class="size7"><span><span class="pali">Ārukam</span> can also mean ‘hurting’ or ‘injuring’. That which hurts me from within is called a disease, and therefore in <span class="pali">urvārukamiva bandhanāt</span><span class="timesi2">, </span>this <span class="pali">bandhanam</span> (bondage) is like a disease which I am suffering from and which leads to my death. The scriptures say that the deadliest disease of all is this <span class="pali">samsāra-roga </span>– the disease of constant becoming and changing. All the time we want to become something other than our own natural essence <span class="pali">(dharma)</span>, which is the Self, or God. A bachelor wants to be married, a married man wants to be a bachelor, a millionaire wants to become a billionaire, and so on. This is all a series of becoming, but whatever you become, its problems come along with it.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span class="timesbi">Thus free me from this disease of wanting to become. Rather, please lead me to discover that ‘I am Infinite, free from all problems and sorrows’.</span></p>

<p class="cent1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="some_text" class="calibre1"/></p>
 
 <p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">Mrtyor </span></p>
 
<p class="size7"><span>We have already examined and discussed many types of death. However, in the <span class="pali">Upaniṣads </span>it is said <span class="pali">pramādo mṛtyuḥ</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n17" href="part0003.html#ch1_no17">17</a></sup> – <span class="pali">pramāda </span>itself is death.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>And what is <span class="pali">pramāda</span>? One simple translation is ‘inadvertence’. For example, when you ask someone to help you send an important email and later you ask, ‘Did you send that message out?’ The reply: ‘Oh no, I was just resting.’ We immediately think, ‘You lazy person!’ However, there is another form of <span class="pali">pramāda</span>, that is, when you ask them and they say, ‘What email?’ That person can’t even remember! Now who is worse, the lazy person or the one who is forgetful? Most of us will say the lazy one, but no, it is the forgetful one! The lazy one at least can and will probably do it (albeit later), but the forgetful one doesn’t even remember that it is to be done! This forgetfulness, this carelessness, only wives will understand what a terrible thing it is! If you are lazy she will tolerate you, but if you forget, then you are really in trouble – try forgetting her birthday and see what happens! Forgetfulness is not an excuse, forgetfulness is <span class="pali">mṛtyuḥ </span>(death).</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>What are we forgetful of? We are forgetful of our own divine nature, forgetful to be grateful for what we have received. <span class="pali">Yajña </span>means remembrance and remembrance leads to liberation. The moment you remember the Lord, you are liberated as effortlessly as a ripe cucumber is severed from a creeper. But when you forget from Whom you have received everything, when you forget what your true nature is, when you forget the knowledge you have received from the Guru, then that itself is <span class="pali">mṛtyuḥ</span>. Thus <span class="pali">Arjuna</span> said, ‘Thank you, O Lord <span class="pali">Kṛṣṇa</span>, for reminding me and saving me.’</span></p> 
 
<p class="size7"><span class="timesbi">Remembrance itself is liberation and forgetfulness is bondage and death.</span></p>

 <p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">Muksiya</span></p>
 
<p class="size7"><span>What is <span class="pali">mukṣīya </span>or <span class="pali">mokṣa</span>? It is freedom, and as we all know, freedom is joy, freedom is happiness. If you are put in a golden cage, even if you are provided every luxury possible, the moment you realise you are bound, you suffer. Bondage is suffering and freedom is bliss. ‘So free me from death, change, illness, pain and suffering.’</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Now, how can we be free from all of these sorrows? Is it by becoming immortal? But we just saw that all ‘becoming’ is bondage. To overcome mortality one must <span class="timesi2">know </span>oneself to be already immortal. Freedom is in knowing, realising, recognising oneself to be the Undying, Unchanging and Eternal Supreme Self, <span class="pali">Brahman</span>.<sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n18" href="part0003.html#ch1_no18">18</a></sup> Upon knowing oneself to be the Infinite, all finitude and sorrow vanishes – just as for one who knows that what he sees is a rope, the erroneous vision of the snake vanishes. True freedom lies within... it is in knowing.</span></p>

<p class="just2"><span class="timesb1">Mamrtat</span></p>
 
<p class="size7"><span>The final prayer in this mantra is <span class="pali">mā’mṛtāt (mukṣīya) –</span> literally meaning ‘May I not be freed from Immortality’. The word <span class="pali">mā </span>is used as a softer form of ‘no’, as an earnest request. In the famous statement of the <span class="pali">Bhagavad Gītā</span>, <span class="pali">Mā phaleṣu kadācana</span><sup class="calibre4"><a id="ch1_n19" href="part0003.html#ch1_no19">19</a></sup>, <span class="pali">mā </span>is not a commanding ‘no’, but more a statement of fact lovingly dressed as benevolent advice: ‘Please do not be attached to the fruits of action.’ Hence, <span class="pali">mā’mṛtāt </span>means ‘Free me from death, but not <span class="pali">(mā) </span>from immortality <span class="pali">(amṛtāt)</span>’. In other words, don’t take 
me away from immortality, don’t allow me to fall back into this world of temptation and change, keep this inspiration in me constantly growing.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>Even though the <span class="pali">Mahā-Mṛtyuñjaya Mantra </span>is a call to Lord <span class="pali">Śiva</span>, or our Guru as <span class="pali">Īśvara</span>, to specifically destroy our bondage, the Vedic mantras with their rich import are ever enthusiastic to indicate the Absolute Reality, <span class="pali">Sacchidānanda </span>– Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. This Absolute Reality is the central theme of the <span class="pali">Upaniṣads </span>and the <span class="pali">Bhagavad Gītā</span>, and hinges on the realisation that the individual self is one with the Supreme Self <span class="pali">(jīva-brahma-aikyam)</span>.

<p class="size7"><span>By <span class="pali">Sugandhim</span>, the all-pervasive <span class="pali">Sat </span>or ‘Pure Existence’ is indicated by comparison to fragrance, which suffuses the air and the perception of which has a transformational effect.

As <span class="pali">Puṣṭivardhanam</span>, He is the purveyor of Bliss or of <span class="pali">Ānanda</span>, for happiness alone nourishes life.</span></p>

<p class="size7"><span>When the individual or <span class="pali">jīva </span>is freed <span class="pali">(mukṣīya) </span>from his identification and attachment <span class="pali">(bandhanāt) </span>to the finite and ever-perishing <span class="pali">(mṛtyor)</span>, he discovers himself to be the Immortal <span class="pali">(Amṛta)</span>, Infinite Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. Thus the oneness between the individual self <span class="pali">(jīvātmā) </span>and the Supreme Self <span class="pali">(Paramātmā) </span>is subtly indicated.

<li class="pad1"><span> Fix a charming picture of Lord <span class="pali">Śiva </span>and your Guru at such a height from the floor that when you sit in front of the portrait, the Lord’s feet are directly in your sightline.</span></li>

<li class="pad1"><span> Spread out a simple mat or <span class="pali">āsana</span>. (Or use a floor cushion.)</span></li>

<li class="pad1"><span> Sit on the <span class="pali">āsana </span>in a comfortable legs-folded position, keeping your back, neck and head in a straight line. (You may use a chair if you are uncomfortable on the floor.)</span></li>

<li class="pad1"><span> To begin with, gaze at the Lord’s feet and slowly raise your sight from His feet to His legs, body and face.</span></li>

<li class="pad1"><span>  Close your eyes, feel His presence within you and try to visualise the Lord exactly as He is in the portrait.</span></li>
<li class="pad1"><span>Before you start chanting the mantra, invoke the blessings of your Guru and Lord <span class="pali">Śiva</span>.</span></li>
<li class="pad1"><span> Now start chanting. First chant loudly, then turn it into a whisper and then finally chant only in your mind. Your chanting should become such that the mantra starts resonating by itself.</span></li>

<li class="pad1"><span> Contemplation: Once the mind is effortlessly chanting the mantra, your intellect can then dive into the meanings you have learnt here. Don’t just sit and merely analyse the logic behind it, but think about whatever you have understood and allow your heart to embrace it. Let it seep into your every bone and breath.</span></li> 

<li class="pad1"><span> Every time you get distracted, resume the loud chanting, then reduce your volume and again dive into your contemplation.</span></li>

<p class="size7"><span>Practise this every day for 10 minutes. Be regular and be sincere. Steadily and slowly increase the duration of your <span class="pali">japa</span>. See what happens.</span></p>
